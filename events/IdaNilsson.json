  "description": "Why does the brain fail to signal hunger in anorexia nervosa, even in states of severe starvation? Prof. Ida Nilsson presents emerging evidence that genetic vulnerability and dieting-induced changes in hypothalamic circuits create a paradoxical response to negative energy balance. By uncovering these mechanisms, this research aims to support more effective biological treatments for recovery."
