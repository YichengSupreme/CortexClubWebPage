  "description": "What makes us hungry and why is body weight shaped by biology as much as behaviour? Prof. Giles Yeo presents cutting-edge work mapping the cellular and molecular architecture of appetite-control circuits, from single-cell atlases of the mouse brain to the first high-resolution spatio-cellular map of the human hypothalamus. A journey from genes to behaviour, with implications for obesity and personalised medicine."
