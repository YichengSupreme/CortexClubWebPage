  "description": "Reproductive function depends on precise patterns of hormone release - but how does the brain generate them? Prof. Allan Herbison investigates the neural circuits controlling fertility, focusing on GnRH and kisspeptin neurons that orchestrate puberty, ovulation, and reproductive health. Using state-of-the-art imaging and genetic tools, this work sheds light on infertility and endocrine disorders."
