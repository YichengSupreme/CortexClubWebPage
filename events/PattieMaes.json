    "date": "2025-11-19",
    "description": "Our entire human experience is increasingly mediated by AI, transforming how we learn, work, consume information, and socialize. But will these developments enhance human thinking and wellbeing, or diminish them? As AI becomes more deeply embedded in daily life, we face a crucial question: How might we design and deploy these systems to augment rather than atrophy our cognitive and social capacities? This talk explores strategies for developing AI that strengthens human capabilities rather than eroding them, ensuring we don't lose the essential qualities that make us human. Pattie Maes is the Germeshausen Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at the MIT Media Lab, where she conducts research at the intersection of human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence."
