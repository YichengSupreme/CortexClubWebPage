  "description": "Dr. Mootaz Salman (DPAG, University of Oxford) discusses mechanisms of blood-brain barrier dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries using patient-derived stem cells. His group designs and builds innovative dynamic 3D multicellular in vitro models including organs-on-a-chip to accurately replicate the blood-brain barrier function under mechanobiological stimuli. "
