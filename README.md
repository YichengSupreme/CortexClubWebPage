## Adding New Events

To add a new event:

1. Create a new JSON file in the `events/` folder (e.g., `event_9.json`)
2. Add the event data:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "unique-event-id",
     "title": "Event Title",
     "date": "2024-12-25",
     "description": "Event description here"
   }
   ```
3. Add the filename to `events/index.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "events": [
       "event_1.json",
       "event_2.json",
       "event_9.json"
     ]
   }
   ```
4. Events will automatically sort into Upcoming/Past based on the current date

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (Local Testing)

Run the included server script:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

This will automatically open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`

### Without Server (Limited)

You can open `index.html` directly, but events won't load due to CORS restrictions. The rest of the site will work fine.

### GitHub Pages

Once pushed to GitHub Pages, all features work perfectly including dynamic event loading!
