  "description": "What does it mean for the brain to be intelligent in an uncertain world? Prof. Denis Burdakov explores how neural circuits integrate energy state, motivation, and environment to guide behaviour, from eating and exercise to learning and performance. By combining physiology, behaviour, and computation, this work reveals the algorithms that allow brains - biological and artificial - to adapt."
